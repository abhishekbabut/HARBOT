# HARBOT
In India, agriculture has traditionally been a labor-intensive industry. However, there is a need to investigate autonomous alternatives in place of conventional ways in order to cater to the fast-expanding population in the face of rising labor expenses. One such procedure in agriculture is harvesting. The greatest care should be taken because picking fruits too early could lower output. This is more obvious, particularly in terrace and greenhouse farming. We, therefore, introduce our ”HAR-BOT” in order to make that process more effective and economical. 
HARBOT is a mobile robot arm manipulator that can locate and choose ripe fruits like tomatoes. Har-bot will navigate a path by means of a line follower without running into any other objects. Using a camera module, it should be able to identify ripe tomatoes and determine its spatial coordinates (depth and x-distance). The robot intends to pluck the identified tomatoes and place them in a basket using a robotic arm. The movement of the robotic arm is controlled by NEMA17 stepper motors. The angle to be turned by the NEMA17 motors to reach the identified tomatoes is calculated using inverse kinematics algorithm. A smartphone app that is installed remotely can control and monitor how Harbot is operating.
